==============================================

Description
-----------

A library for binding input keys to actions, and modifying mouse behaviour. Keys can be
bound to actions, and then translated during runtime. `Keys` are mapped to `Actions` using
a `HashMap`, so lookup time is constant.

Example
-------

    extern crate glutin_window;
    extern crate piston;
    extern crate rebind;
    
    use glutin_window::GlutinWindow;
    use piston::event_loop::Events;
    use piston::input::{Event, Input};
    use piston::input::Button::Keyboard;
    use piston::input::keyboard::Key;
    use piston::window::WindowSettings;
    use rebind::{Action, InputTranslator, RebindBuilder, Translated};
    
    #[derive(Clone, Copy, Eq, Hash, Ord, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
    enum MyAction {
        Action1, Action2
    }
    
    impl Action for MyAction { }
    
    fn main() {
        let window: GlutinWindow = WindowSettings::new("rebind-example", (800, 600))
            .build()
            .unwrap_or_else(|e| panic!("Could not create window: {}", e));
    
        let translator = RebindBuilder::<MyAction>::new((800, 600).into())
            .with_action_mapping(Keyboard(Key::D1), MyAction::Action1)
            .with_action_mapping(Keyboard(Key::A),  MyAction::Action1)
            .with_action_mapping(Keyboard(Key::D2), MyAction::Action2)
            .with_action_mapping(Keyboard(Key::B),  MyAction::Action2)
            .build_translator();
    
        for e in window.events() {
            if let Event::Input(ref i) = e {
                if let Some(a) = translator.translate(i) {
                    match a {
                        Translated::Press(MyAction::Action1) => {
                            println!("Action 1 pressed!");
                        },
                        Translated::Press(MyAction::Action2) => {
                            println!("Action 2 pressed!");
                        },
                        _ => { }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Main improvements to be made:
-----------------------------

* Implement conversion from InputTranslator to InputRebind
* Improve the API: Is the distinction between InputRebind and InputTranslator necessary or useful?
* Add serialisation
* Add mouse sensitivity options
* Add tests/benchmarks

Contributions welcome.
